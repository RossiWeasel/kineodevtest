Given the following tables:

create schema e3test;

use e3test;

CREATE TABLE company (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
   name VARCHAR(100),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE = InnoDB ROW_FORMAT = DEFAULT;

CREATE TABLE employee (
   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
   first_name VARCHAR(100),
   last_name VARCHAR(100),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE = InnoDB ROW_FORMAT = DEFAULT;


- Company:
Id
Name

- Employee:
Id
First Name
Last Name


- Database tables are provided.
- Initial JPA entities are provided.

Requirements 1 and 2 are mandatory. The other requirements are in a suggested order, however you may work on them in any order you like.

1. A company may have many employees and one employee can only work for one company. Please add this relationship to the database tables.
2. Add the previous relationship to the JPA entities.

3. Create REST end-point to delete an employee by id.
4. Create REST end-point to delete a company by id. Companies can only be deleted if they no longer have employees.
5. Create a "Search" REST end-point to search employees by any of the "Employee" table fields (Id, First Name or Last Name). The result should be ordered by First Name alphabetically.
6. Create the REST end-point to create and update Employees in the system. The endpoint should support updating First Name, Last Name and Company. First Name and Last Name can contain only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, apostrophe ('), hyphen (-) and white space.
7. Extend the search end-point created in (5) to search employee by Company Name or Company Id. Update the endpoint to first group employees by company, then order by first name alphabetically.
