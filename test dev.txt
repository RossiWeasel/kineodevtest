1. Create tables in database
2. Create JPA entities
3. Create end-points (JSON input and output) for CRUD operations for Company, Employee and City.
4. Create end-point (JSON output) to report the list of users showing:
User Id - Complete user name (first name and last name in the same column) - Employee's city name - Employee's company name.
!!! Don't show/retrieve city or company id !!!

- Using JPARepository or CRUDRepository is suggested.
- Command to run the project: mvn spring-boot:run

You will receive extra points for: 
Create local git project for this project, Junit tests, Front end development and Validations (back-end or front-end)

Eveything will be evaluated, not only the result.
